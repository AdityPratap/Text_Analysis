# Text_Analysis
This document aims to guide users on how to run a Python script that extracts textual data from URLs, performs text analysis, and generates an output in Excel format.
Dependencies: 
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher recommended)
pip (Python package installer)
Required Python packages:
         requests
        BeautifulSoup (bs4)
	nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
        spacy
        pandas

Install these dependencies using pip:
  	
   	pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk spacy pandas

Setup:
Python Installation:
Install Python from the official Python website if not installed.
Package Installation:
Open a command prompt or terminal.
Installing the required packages using pip:

	pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk spacy pandas

Download NLTK Resources:
After installing nltk, download the necessary resources:

	python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords vader_lexicon cmudict


Download spaCy Model:
Download and install the English model for spaCy:

	python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Download Input and Output Files:

Place the Input.xlsx and Output Data Structure.xlsx files in the same directory as your Python script (NTLK.py).
Running the Script:
Open Command Prompt or Terminal:
Navigate to the directory where your Python script (NTLK.py) is located.
Run the Script:
Execute the code by running the following command:

			python NTLK.py
Script Execution:
The script will extract data from each URL specified in Input.xlsx, perform text analysis, and generate an output file Output Data Structure.xlsx with the computed variables.
Handling Errors:
If you encounter any errors during script execution (e.g., URL extraction failure, missing dependencies), check the error message for guidance on troubleshooting. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and URLs are accessible.
Conclusion: This document provides instructions on setting up and running a Python script for text analysis and data extraction. Follow the steps outlined to execute the script successfully and generate the desired output.
